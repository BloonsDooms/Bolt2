1.0.9

General
- Negative winstreaks deduct less rank (20 -> 15 each)
- System to limit rank inflation is relaxed more to allow higher rank growth (only 1-3 more or less a game)
- Ranked ties scramble winstreaks to allow different teams next round
- Note: working on balancing between rank creating balanced teams and diverse teams while being a "feel-good" experience

Items
- Armor resets flag capture timer to 0.5s when hit on point capture mode (if over 0.5s captured)
- Traps has 1 tick delay before making hiss sound when in range

Bug Fixes
- Improved spawn point owner detection
- Generator text displayed on coves during non CtF
- Flag drop sound wound be delayed

Known issues
- Placeables can give wrong owner in rare cases. Working on a perfect solution
- Walls can lift objects on nearby walls is weird cases
- Pushing players in lobby is a issue in high player count lobbies. Considering removing player push entirely in lobby.
